            This is a quick+easy minecraft launcher. It is cracked, choses your
            username basicly randomly, but keeps it the same across all installs
            per-os-username (same os username=same minecraft username/same
            minecraft uuid. [It makes a Sha1 hash of your os username for anyone curious.])
